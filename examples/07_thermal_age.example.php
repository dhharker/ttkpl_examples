/**
 * Example #7
 * What is thermal age and where can I get some?
 */

/**
 * Thermal age is a way of normalising time for temperature, it is measured in "10째C thermal years".
 * The age of a specimen in thermal years is the number of years at a constant 10째C it would have
 * taken to cause the same amount of degradation to take place. If you insist, you can think of
 * thermal age being "equivalent years deep in a cave in northern Germany".
 *
 * Thermal age is a powerful concept because it allows direct comparison between samples of different
 * ages, from different sites, time periods or parts of the world entirely. This aids in decision
 * making on funding provision, destructive sampling of valuable samples as well as helping highlight
 * contamination.
 *
 * Let's get cracking. Most of this example has been covered in previous installments, this is where
 * we start bringing it all together.
 *
 * In this example we'll model a burial that's been under ground for a few thousand years, then dug
 * up and kept in a box somewhere for a load more years (a habit archaeologists have).
